# Image-classifcation-using-convolution-Neural-Netwrok-CNN

This project is aims to classify Fashion-MNIST data using convolution nueral network.
Dataset:Fashion-MNIST 
train.csv,val.csv test.csv are comma seperated value files of training,validation and testing data respectively.
Below is the command to run this code or you can run this by run.sh in this file i have already worte the script neede for training this network(convolutio nueral network for image classification)
